# HackHarvard-2022

## Problem: 
Students are so busy with their extra-curriculars that occasionally they are too overwhelmed to manage a planner week in and week out.

## Solution: 
Simplify the life of users by putting the power to make events in the hands of individual organizations. Users join a club in the club search page and the planned events for that organization are automatically added to their calendar page.

## Features:
- User Authentication
- Calendar Filter
- Club Finder 
- My Clubs Page
- Profile
